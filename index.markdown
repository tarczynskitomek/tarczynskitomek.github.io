# whois
![Me](/tt.jpg){:width="200px"} 

I am a passionate self-taught Software Engineer with experience in Java and Kotlin, and a tiny bit of Angular development.

I enjoy nerding over new technologies, learning how and where it's worth applying them, and how they are implemented internally. I do enjoy
working with other people with close cooperation with business.

*But most of all, I enjoy getting thigs done - that's the moment dopamine kicks in!*

### Bonus Points
- I conside myself a highly communicative Software Engineer with plenty of soft skills...
- ... and a strangely satifying sense of humour.

### Technologies and Languages
- Kotlin, Java and Groovy - mostly Kotlin for the last two years.
- TypeScript and JavaScript - with Angular 7+ and ReactJS mostly.
- Go - just to spice things up with a lower-level, modern language.

### In my Spare Time
- *I code* to try out new things. My professional career is centered around webapps backend development in Java, but I have a continues hunger for knowlege, and I can't help learning new things. I want to find a balance between specialization, and general broad knowlegde in the wast sea of available technologies both frontend and backed. I believe that trying out new things broadens one's horizons.
- *I read* to get my head relaxed
